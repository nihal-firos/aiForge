    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # On macOS/Linux

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your secret keys:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
    SECRET_KEY="your_django_development_secret_key"
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser:**
    This will be your first admin/teacher account.
    ```sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7.  **Run the development server:**

    ```
    Your project will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on **Render**. The deployment process uses `gunicorn` as the web server and `whitenoise` for serving static files. The `build.sh` script in the repository automates the build process on Render by running `collectstatic` and `migrate` commands.

Key environment variables for production include `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `DEBUG=False`.
